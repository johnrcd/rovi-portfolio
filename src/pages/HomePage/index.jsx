                        I'm a programmer with a passion for application and game development. My interest began through the Interactive Digital Media program offered at my high school, where my first projects were games built in JavaScript. I started to tinker around with assignments to see how they worked, made some games of my own, and before I knew it, I was hooked.

                    <p>
                        Nowadays, my programming is significantly less game-oriented. I'm currently in the Business Information Technology program at Red River College Polytechnic, where I'm learning about IT and software development.

                        A 2D platformer about a mouse trying to get home. This project was my first attempt to create a fully realized game, rather than just another prototype or a proof-of-concept. Developed over a period of five months, released for Slow Jam Winnipeg 2022.
